You can use the following commands in this discord:

### Game Info
The `$gameinfo <galaxy_name> <focus>` command gives you information about the settings of a completed, in progress or waiting game.

The first direction, the `<galaxy_name>`, is the name of the game you want to know the settings of. You can find this name in the top left of the screen when you are in the game. If however the galaxy name is not unique, you will be asked to use the galaxy-id instead, this is a unique code that can be found at the end of the url when you are in the game.

The second direction, the `<focus>`, asks what kind of settings you want to know of. There are five kinds of settings.

- If you want to see the general settings, such as the stars required for victory, playerLimit, anonymity and more, use `general`.
- If you want to see the galaxy settings, such as carrier cost, warpgate cost, specialist cost and more, use `galaxy`.
- If you want to see the player settings, such as the starting conditions and trading conditions, use `player`.
- If you want to see the technology settings, such as the starting technologies and their cost, use `technology`.
- If you want to see the time settings, such as the tick/turn duration or whether or not a game is real time, use `time`.

### Game Invite
The `$invite <game_link>` creates an embed message from the game you want promoted. This message contains a summary of the most important settings of a game.

This summary consists of, the gamemode, the anonimity, the dark settings, the maximum amount of players, the amount of stars per player, the galaxy type, the specialist currency, whether trading credits and technology is enabled and what kind of time settings are going on in the game.

For more info on a game, you can use the gameinfo command.
