# Stars

Stars are the key to victory in Solaris, capture the most stars to win!

Stars are displayed as star shaped icons with a circular halo denoating which
player the star belongs to by colour. When zoomed in the star will display
garrison and how many carriers are orbiting the star (if any) followed by the
star's name. Above the star there will be 3 numbers, these represent the star's
Economy, Industry and Science infrastructure respectively.
Click on the star to view it in detail.

Stars on the map display the following details:

 - The star name
 - The star owning player denoted by its colour
 - The star's total garrison
 - The star's infrastructure (Economy, Industry, Science)
 - Whether the star has a **warp gate** (additional halo)
 - Whether the star has more than 1 player in orbit

Click on a star to view the star statistics in detail. This screen displays all
of the information related to the star. In order displayed in the image, is the
star name, a button for centering on the star, a button to close the menu, the
owner of the star, the star's natural/terraformed resources, the star's economy,
industry, and science levels, how many ships are stationed at the star, the
specialist that is stationed at the star, and how many ships the star
manufactures every tick. Below that are the buttons to purchase more economy,
industry, and science, as well as a button for creating a carrier at the star
and a button for purchasing a warpgate at the star.

## Special Star Types

Some stars are different and grant special buffs and abilities, the possible star types are as follows:

- **Normal Stars** - These stars have no special buffs or abilities.
- **Black Holes** - Black Holes have `+3` Scanning Range but have reduced natural resources.
- **Nebulas** - Ships inside a Nebula are hidden from all other players.
- **Asteroid Fields** - Asteroid Fields have `x2` Defender Bonus in combat.
- **Binary Stars** - Binary Star systems start with additional natural resources.
- **Worm Holes** - Stars with Worm Holes come in pairs, travel between connected worm holes takes `1 tick`.

## Infrastructure

There are 3 types of infrastructure that can be built at stars:

 - **Economy** - Increases income at production, each point of Economy earns 10
   credits on the production tick.
 - **Industry** - Increases ship production rate.
 - **Science** - Increases research speed. Each point of Science will generate
   one research point per tick for the chosen current technology that is being
   researched.

When you select a star its Hyperspace Range and Scanning Range will become
visible. Hyperspace Range is displayed as a ridged ring centered on the star and
the Scanning Range is displayed as a solid circle around the star.

## Resources

A star's natural resources determines how many credits it will cost to build
infrastructure. The higher the natural resources, the cheaper it costs to
upgrade.
Stars with natural resources tend to be highly saught after.

The Terraforming technology improves the star's natural resources and makes
building infrastructure cheaper.

 - Upgrade star infrastructure improve the star's cash yield, increase ship
   production and speed up research.
 - Build a Carrier to transport ships through hyperspace.
 - Build a Warp Gate to accelerate carrier movement.
 - Upgrade the Star by hiring a Specialist which grants special abilities.

## Warp Gates

**Warp Gates** will improve the speed by times 3 of what Carriers typically
travel between star. A warp gate must be built at the departure star and the
destination star in order for a Carrier to receive the speed boost. The warp
gate speed boost also multiplies by 3 even if the traveling carrier has a speed
boost from a specialist. Therefore, if the carrier has a times 2 speed boost
from a specialist, then when that carrier is traveling between two warp gates it
will travel at times 6 speed.

## Star Indicators

When zoomed in, you will be able to see the star's indicator which gives an at-a-glance information about the star. For example an `125/3` indicator displays that the star has `125` ships in total, with `3` carriers in orbit. The full format is as follows:

```
<total garrison>/<carrier count>*+
```

- `*` - Indicates that the star garrison may not be accurate, the star or a carrier in orbit has been **scrambled**. (See Scrambler specialist).
- `+` - Indicates that the star has more than 1 player in orbit.

## Abandoning Stars

You may choose to **abandon a star**, in which case all Carriers and Ships at
the star will be destroyed and all infrastructure will remain intact, including
a warp gate if present.

When abandoned the warp gate will become inactive until the star is claimed
again, so it will not grant a speed boost to incoming Carriers.

If an ally is in orbit when you abandon a star, that player will capture the star on the next tick. If there are more than 1 ally, then
the player with the highest number of ships in a single carrier will capture the abandoned star.
