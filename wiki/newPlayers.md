# New Players

As a new player, you must first complete a **New Player Game** in order to progress to playing in other **Official** games.

You can find the new player game by navigating from the Main Menu to **Join Game -> New Players**. You will likely be faced up against players who are also new and are just starting up.

*Note: New Player Games do not affect Rank or Victories.*

## Tips For Beginners

1. Complete the tutorial - The tutorial is a great place to start and should give you the basics on how to play.
2. Read the Wiki - The Wiki aims to be a complete guide on everything about the game.
3. Talk to players - Whether this is in game or in community channels, learn from experienced players to get a head start.
4. Don't take the game too seriously and have fun.

## How To Progress to Official Games

To join an **Official** game, you must be considered to be an *established player*. An established player is:

- A player who has 1 or more **Rank**.
- Or a player who has **completed** at least 1 game.

To achieve this, simply play through a new player game to completion. Once you've completed a new player game, you will be able to progress.

### Why Is There A New Player Restriction?

Solaris is a niche genre and does not appeal to everybody. The New Player restrictions act as a filter to help increase the quality and improve the experience for all players in official games.

*Note: If you strongly feel that you are committed to playing in official game modes you may ask a developer to remove the new player restriction for you.*
