# The Solaris Wiki

## Introduction

[Solaris](https://solaris.games) is a slow paced browser game based on diplomacy, strategy and intrigue.
To win the game, you must capture stars.

You will not be alone, other players will also be trying to achieve the same
goal. You must build diplomatic relations with other players to create alliances,
trade agreements and possibly even subterfuge to backstab your allies and claim
victory.

The galaxy contains stars that can be upgraded and will build ships for carriers
that will traverse across the galaxy in order to capture unclaimed stars or
fight other players to capture theirs.


## Diplomacy

Diplomacy plays a huge role in [Solaris](https://solaris.games), the key to victory is not only galactic
conquest, but also building relations with allies. You may first want to
establish an alliance early on in the game to gain an advantage.

You should build trade agreements with other players, there will almost
certainly be other players and alliances who will have trade agreements and it
is important to keep up with these players' technology levels otherwise you will
be at a disadvantage.

It may prove to be useful to become the sole player who has a large technology
lead of a single technology. For example if you have the highest Weapons
technology then other players will want to trade with you and may want to stay
friendly with you.

Be aware that other players may be plotting to destroy your empire, especially
if you have a lead or are relatively weak. Remember to keep communications open
and your borders protected from unwanted aggression.


## Trade

Trade is an integral part of diplomacy. When you select a player in a game there
will be an option to trade either technology or credits.

Trading technology with another player has a transaction fee. For each trade involving technology, the system imposes a fee depending on the level of technology and the game's settings, which the gifting player pays when they send the technology. In a standard game the transfer cost of technology is $15 per tech level, so trading a level 2 technology would cost $30 and a level 3 technology would cost $45.

Alongside technology you can also send credits to another player. To send
credits to a player simply input how much you want to give to the player in the
text box at the bottom.

To keep track of trade there is a ledger. It details how much a player owes.
Players have the option to repay their debt or the creditor can forgive all
debt.

Depending on game settings a player may have to be in scanning distance with
another player in order to trade with them.


## Galaxy

The galaxy map will display the following:

 - Stars
 - Carriers
 - Chicken Farms
 - Specialists

### Stars

Stars are displayed as star shaped icons with a circular halo denoating which
player the star belongs to by colour. When zoomed in the star will display
garrison and how many carriers are orbiting the star (if any) followed by the
star's name. Above the star there will be 3 numbers, these represent the star's
Economy, Industry and Science infrastructure respectively.
Click on the star to view it in detail.

![A star with 95 garrison, no carriers, and 5 Economic, 4 Industry and 1 Science
infrastructure](img/star-closeup.png)

If star has a chicken farm then it will be displayed with an additional halo.

### Carriers

Carriers are displayed as small ship icons with a circular coloured halo, much
like stars. The number of ships that a carrier has will be displayed when zoomed
in. Click on the carrier to view it in detail.

![Two carriers flying on the map](img/carriers.png)

Carriers that have waypoints will have a line drawn to their destination.
If those waypoints are looped then the line will be slightly thinner.

### Specialists

If a star or carrier has a specialist, the matching specialist icon will be
displayed instead of the standard star/carrier icon. To view the specialist in
detail, click on the star/carrier and scroll to the "Specialist" section.
Specialists can provide any number of modifiers to a star or carrier's
statistics, and are fundamental to a strategically successful game.

### Galaxy Territories

If you zoom far out the territories held by players will be visible.
This gives you a good indication of where empires are located, and you will be
able to identify strong areas and weak points that are cut off from the rest of
a player's stars. There are two different styles of territory appearance,
which can be accessed from the in-game options menu.

![The galaxy map showing 5 (more or less) large empires](img/galaxy.png)


## Stars

Stars on the map display the following details:

 - The star name
 - The star owning player denoted by its colour
 - The star's total garrison
 - The star's infrastructure (Economy, Industry, Science)
 - Whether the star has a chicken farm

Click on a star to view the star statistics in detail. This screen displays all
of the information related to the star. In order displayed in the image, is the
star name, a button for centering on the star, a button to close the menu, the
owner of the star, the star's natural/terraformed resources, the star's economy,
industry, and science levels, how many ships are stationed at the star, the
specialist that is stationed at the star, and how many ships the star
manufactures every tick. Below that are the buttons to purchase more economy,
industry, and science, as well as a button for creating a carrier at the star
and a button for purchasing a chicken farm at the star.

![The menu of a star](img/star-menu.png)

A star's natural resources determines how many credits it will cost to build
infrastructure. The higher the natural resources, the cheaper it costs to
upgrade.
Stars with natural resources tend to be highly saught after.

The Terraforming technology improves the star's natural resources and makes
building infrastructure cheaper.

 - Upgrade star infrastructure improve the star's cash yield, increase ship
   production and speed up research.
 - Build a Carrier to transport ships through hyperspace.
 - Build a Chicken Farm to accelerate carrier movement.
 - Upgrade the Star by hiring a Specialist which grants special abilities.

**Chicken Farms** will improve the speed by times 3 of what Carriers typically
travel between star. A chicken farm must be built at the departure star and the
destination star in order for a Carrier to receive the speed boost. The chicken
farm speed boost also multiplies by 3 even if the traveling carrier has a speed
boost from a specialist. Therefore, if the carrier has a times 2 speed boost
from a specialist, then when that carrier is traveling between two chicken farm it
will travel at times 6 speed.

![A star with a chicken farm](img/warp-gate.png)

You may choose to **abandon a star**, in which case all Carriers and Ships at
the star will be destroyed and all infrastructure will remain intact, including
a chicken farm if present.

When abandoned the chicken farm will become inactive until the star is claimed
again, so it will not grant a speed boost to incoming Carriers.

If an ally is in orbit when you abandon a star, that player will capture the star on the next tick. If there are more than 1 ally, then
the player with the highest number of ships in a single carrier will capture the abandoned star.


## Infrastructure

There are 3 types of infrastructure that can be built at stars:

 - **Economy** - Increases income at production, each point of Economy earns 10
   credits on the production tick.
 - **Industry** - Increases ship production rate.
 - **Science** - Increases research speed. Each point of Science will generate
   one research point per tick for the chosen current technology that is being
   researched.

![The menu to build infrastructure on a star](img/infrastructure-menu.png)

When you select a star its Hyperspace Range and Scanning Range will become
visible. Hyperspace Range is displayed as a ridged ring centered on the star and
the Scanning Range is displayed as a solid circle around the star.


## Carriers

Carriers are used to transport Ships through hyperspace to reach other Stars.
They can only be built at Stars and must hold a minimum of 1 Ship.

 - Build a Carrier at a star.
 - Plot the waypoints that the Carrier will follow.
 - Transfer Ships between Carriers and Stars.
 - Capture neutral or enemy Stars by sending a Carrier to one.
 - Send a Carrier to intercept an incoming enemy Carrier.
 - Purchase a specialist on a carrier to grant special abilities.

![The menu of a carrier](img/carrier-menu.png)

Carriers are displayed as small ship icons with a coloured shape, matching its
owner's stars.
The number of ships that a carrier has is displayed when you zoom in on it.
Click on the carrier to view its statistics in detail.

Carriers that have waypoints will have a line drawn to their destination.
To set a carrier's waypoints, (where it will travel to) click on the + symbol in
the carrier's menu. You can then click on stars to add them to the carrier's
queue. A carrier can have any amount of scheduled waypoints. If those waypoints
are looped then the waypoint line will appear fainter. You can loop a carrier's
waypoints at any point by clicking the "loop" button in the carrier's menu.
The carrier will then endlessly follow its waypoints, traveling from from the
last waypoint of its que to the first one when it reaches the end of its path.
To loop a carrier, the two ends of its waypoint que must be within valid range
of each other.

By default a Carrier will transfer **all** garrisoned Ships at the Star it was
built at, this can be configured in the menu settings.

By default, Carrier waypoints will **Collect All Ships** when landing at a
destination. To change that, after setting a carrier's waypoints click save and
edit to change what actions the carrier will perform at its next waypoint.

Carriers can also be gifted to other players. When a gifted carrier arrives at
its destination the player who owns the star will gain control of the carrier
and its ships. Note that if a carrier has a specialist, that specialist will be
retired.

## Alliances

Your diplomatic status to other players can be changed in the **Menu -> Diplomacy** (hotkey D) screen. If both you and another player set each other to **allied** then you both will receive the following benefits:

- You may visit allied stars.
- When in orbit at an allied star, your scanning range will take effect.

**Warning** - An alliance can be broken at any time and combat will occur at contested stars.

## Combat

Combat occurs when a Carrier arrives at an enemy Star or when a Carrier
intercepts an enemy Carrier in hyperspace. The combat summary can be viewed in
the event log.

![Summary of a combat in the event log](img/combat-summary.png)

When 2 opposing Carriers arrive at a Star on the same tick, the Carrier that
travelled the least distance in the current tick will arrive at the Star first
and receive the Defender Bonus (if enabled).

Starting with the defender, each player takes it in turns to deal damage to the
opposing player. Damage dealt per turn is equal to the effective weapons level,
factoring in weapons technology and specialist abilities.
Damage is dealt roughly equally to all Carriers and the Star per turn.

If multiple opposing Players are in combat at the same time, they will be split
into Attackers and Defenders. Where the defender is the player who owns the star
and the attackers are all other players.
Combat is repeated until there is one player remaining.

When a Star is captured, all of its Economy is destroyed and the winner is
awarded 10 credits per point of Economy. Industry, Science, Warp Gates and
Star Specialists are undamaged and are captured by the winning player.

Combat can also occur between two carriers. When two carriers from different
players intercept each other they will engage in carrier to carrier combat.
In carrier to carrier combat there is no defender bonus.

The combat calculator is a useful tool to predict the outcome of combat.
Simply input the defender and attacker's weapons level and number of ships and
it will present the outcome.

### Combat Weapons Technology
When specialists with Weapons buffs/debuffs participate in combat, the following rules apply:

```
effective weapons level = max debuff + max buff
```

1. Defender bonus is applied **after** effective weapons level is calculated.
2. Weapon deductions (i.e Infiltrator specialist) is applied **after** effective weapons level is calculated.
3. If multiple specialists with buffs/debuffs participate, then the **highest** buff and **lowest** debuff are used.

For example:
- Specialist A has Weapons +3
- Specialist B has Weapons +1
- Specialist C has Weapons -2
- `effective weapons level = -2 + 3 = +1 weapons` *(Specialist B is ignored)*

### Formal Alliance Combat Rules
When formal alliances is enabled then a there are a few conditions that need to be met in order for combat to take place:
1. When a carrier arrives at a star, if the player is allied with the defender then no combat occurs.
2. When a carrier arrives at a star, if the player is enemies with the defender then combat occurs.
2a. Carriers in orbit who are allied to the defender will help defend.
2b. If the attacker wins and captures the star, then combat will repeat until there are no enemies to the defender.
3. When a carrier intercepts another carrier in space, then combat occurs between enemies.
4. When a player changes their diplomatic status from Allied to Enemy, then combat occurs.

Note: More than 2 players can be in orbit at the star providing that they are allied with the defender. Combat will not occur
if the guest players are enemies but are both allied to the defender.

## Science & Technology

Science infrastructure built at Stars contribute to the overall research amount
per tick for the chosen technology that is being researched.
More Science infrastructure increases the speed of which new technology is
researched.

Open the Research screen to view the current research and set the next research.
The types of technologies are as follows:

![The Research menu](img/research-menu.png)

 - **Scanning** - Improves the visible area star a star can see.
   The higher your scanning, the further you can see. The equation is `(scanning + 1) * lightYear`.
 - **Hyperspace Range** - Improves the distance a carrier can travel in between
   each waypoint. The equation is `(hyperspace + 1.5) * lightYear`.
 - **Terraforming** - Improves the natural resources at Stars to make
   infrastructure upgrades cheaper.
 - **Experimentation** - Grants a `50` bonus points per level to a random
   technology each production.
 - **Weapons** - Improves the amount of enemy carriers each friendly carrier
   destroys in combat. Each carrier destroys enemy carriers exactly equal to the
   local weapons level.
 - **Banking** - Earns extra credits every production cycle. For experimental banking the equation is `(banking * 75) + (0.15 * banking * totalEco)` and for legacy banking its `banking * 75`.
 - **Manufacturing** - Increases ship production rate on all stars. The exact
   formula is a star produces `(X*(Y+5))/T` ships per tick, where `X` is the
   star's industry, `Y` is the star's manufacturing level, and `T` is the number
   of ticks in every production cycle.
 - **Specialists** - Increases the number of specialist tokens awarded at the
   end of a galactic cycle, these are used to hire specialists.

Note: A `lightYear` distance unit is `50`.

## Turn Based Games

Turn based games play differently to real time games.
The game does not run in real time, however runs in tick intervals.

When all players are ready, a given number of ticks (based on game settings)
will happen all at once. This means that games can be played much much faster
than real time games or allow players who do not have enough time to monitor
real time games to play competitively.

Like in real time games, turn based games have an auto-resign function.
If a player misses a number of consecutive turns equal to the game’s settings,
or doesn’t do anything on the first turn, that player will be automatically
resigned.


## Achievements

Your game statistics are tracked whilst playing [Solaris](https://solaris.games) and you can view a
breakdown of your achievements on the Achievements page.
You can also view other player’s achievements by selecting their name on the
leaderboard.

### Game Leaderboard Rankings
When a game ends, rank is awarded to all players using the following rules:

- The leaderboard is ordered by stars, then by ships, then by carriers, then by defeated date (undefeated ordered above defeated).
- `rank awarded = (number of players / 2)` - zero based leaderboard position
- For first place its `rank awarded = number of players`
- AFK players are not awarded positive rank, they will receieve negative rank (at least -1).
- Players who have filled AFK slots are awarded 1.5x rank rounded up (at least 0).

So for example, in a 4 player game:
- 1st place receives 4 rank.
- 2nd place receives 1 rank.
- 3rd place receives 0 rank.
- 4th receives -1 rank.

Additionally:
- 1st place receives a galactic credit.
- Players who are undefeated and active (not AFK) receive +1 to their completed statistic on their profile.
- Players cannot have less than 0 rank in their profiles.
- Rank is not awarded in New Player Games.
- Rank is not awarded unless the game has completed 3 galactic cycles.
