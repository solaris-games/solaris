# The Solaris Wiki

## Overview

[Solaris](https://solaris.games) is a slow paced browser game based on diplomacy, strategy and intrigue. To win the game, you must capture stars.

You will not be alone, other players will also be trying to achieve the same goal. You must build diplomatic relations with other players to create alliances, trade agreements and possibly even subterfuge to backstab your allies and claim victory.

The galaxy contains stars that can be upgraded and will build ships for carriers that will traverse across the galaxy in order to capture unclaimed stars or fight other players to capture theirs.
