# Game Types and Win Conditions
There are a few different game modes, types and win conditions in Solaris. These are as follows:

- **Conquest** - This is the standard way to play Solaris, players fight over stars and attempt to capture the target number of stars to win the game.
- **Dark Mode** - Players are limited to what they can see within their scanning range, only stars and carriers in scanning range are visible.
- **Extra Dark Mode** - Dark mode on steriods, along with dark mode settings the leaderboard and player statistics are based on your scanning range.
- **Capital Conquest** - This is the same as Conquest however players fight to capture other player's capital stars.
- **King of the Hill** - Players fight to capture and hold the center star for a given amount of time, once the center star is captured the countdown to the end of the game begins.
- **Battle Royale** - Players fight to stay alive in an ever shrinking galaxy, last player alive wins the game.
- **Orbital** - Players fight to control stars in a rotating galaxy that orbits the center.
- **Tiny Galaxy** - Standard mode but smaller.
- **32 Player** - Solaris at its finest, play in a huge sprawling galaxy for 32 players.

## Turn Based
Turn based games play differently to real time games. The game does not run in real time, however runs in tick intervals.

When all players are ready, a given number of ticks (based on game settings) will happen all at once. This means that games can be played much much faster than real time games or allow players who do not have enough time to monitor real time games to play competitively.

Like in real time games, turn based games have an auto-resign function. If a player misses a number of consecutive turns equal to the game’s settings, or doesn’t do anything on the first turn, that player will be automatically resigned.
