            players are doing until the tick has finished.

            This will be a combination of the current state of the galaxy for the player and
            the previous tick's galaxy data for other players.

            The following logic will be applied to the galaxy:
            1. Apply previous tick's data to all STARS the player does not own.
                - Ships, specialist, warp gate and infrastructure needs to be reset.
            2. Apply previous tick's data to all CARRIERS the player does not own.
                - Remove any carriers that exist in the current tick but not in the previous tick.
                - Ships, specialist and gift status needs to be reset.
            3. Continue to run through current logic as we do today.
